To calculate the full solution for psi, use the function 'CavityFlowCalculator'. The 
comments in the MATLAB function should explain how to use it. This function calls all 
of the other functions uploaded here apart from CFCALphas. CFCAlphas can instead be used to
calculate a large set of eigenvalues. The derivation of the finite difference scheme is
presented in the PDF FDDerivation.
